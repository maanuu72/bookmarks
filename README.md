# Bookmarks

The goal of this project is manage bookmarks. You can add or delete which you want

In AppComponent, I initialize the store so as to can see information at the begining

In shared folder, I created a component which is used in multiple components

I want you to know that:
- I didn't used git branches because of the hurry
- I didn't comment because of the simplicity

but I know that they are important and I use to do both
